## Summary
There is a possible bias for members than non-members because members are receiving an extra perk. Even though there were only 90 members, almost half of them gave a 5-star rating. With non-members, there were over 37,385 reviews but less than half gave a 5-star rating. Non-members are probably just more honest since they are not necessarily required to even give a review at all. Another analysis I would do to support my statment would be to use another dataset and see if the results are similar.
